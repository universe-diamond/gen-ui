# Generative UI with LangChain.js ðŸ¦œðŸ”—

## Overview

This application aims to provide a template for building generative UI applications with LangChain.js.
It comes pre-built with a few UI features which you can use to play about with gen ui. The UI components are built using [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
And you can try out the production version [here].

## Getting Started

### Installation

Copy the [`.env.example`](./.env.example) file to `.env`:

The `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required. LangSmith keys are optional, but highly recommended if you plan on developing this application further.

Create a new [GitHub PAT (Personal Access Token)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the `repo` scope.

[Create a free Geocode account](https://geocode.xyz/api).
